# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Simulation System

A C++ program simulating real-time flight operations, including passenger management, flight statuses, and environmental factors like fuel consumption and weather conditions. The system provides an interactive console interface, allowing users to view specific details such as flight statuses, passenger information, and weather conditions for each airplane.

## üåü Features

- **Real-Time Flight Status Updates**: Each airplane in the simulation goes through realistic status changes (Idle, Taking Off, In Flight, Landing, Landed, and Maintenance).
- **Passenger Management**: Track individual passenger details such as ticket class and baggage weight.
- **Dynamic Fuel Consumption**: Fuel levels decrease based on airplane speed, with low-fuel warnings and realistic distance tracking.
- **Weather Simulation**: Random weather conditions affect flight delays, with "Clear," "Rainy," and "Stormy" scenarios.
- **Interactive Console**: Control the simulation in real-time with keyboard commands to pause, resume, and display specific information.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as GCC or MSVC.

### Cloning the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

`bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-simulation-system.git
cd flight-simulation-system`

Run the program:
`./flight_simulation`

For Windows users, run the compiled .exe file instead:
flight_simulation.exe

## üïπÔ∏è Usage
Interactive Controls
Key	Action
- f	Show detailed flight status for all airplanes
- s	Show passenger information for each airplane
- w	Display current weather condition for flights
- p	Pause/resume the simulation
- e	Exit the simulation
