‚úàÔ∏è Flight Simulation System
A C++ program simulating real-time flight operations, including passenger management, flight statuses, and environmental factors like fuel consumption and weather conditions. The system provides an interactive console interface, allowing users to view specific details such as flight statuses, passenger information, and weather conditions for each airplane.

üåü Features
Real-Time Flight Status Updates: Each airplane in the simulation goes through realistic status changes (Idle, Taking Off, In Flight, Landing, Landed, and Maintenance).
Passenger Management: Track individual passenger details such as ticket class and baggage weight.
Dynamic Fuel Consumption: Fuel levels decrease based on airplane speed, with low-fuel warnings and realistic distance tracking.
Weather Simulation: Random weather conditions affect flight delays, with "Clear," "Rainy," and "Stormy" scenarios.
Interactive Console: Control the simulation in real-time with keyboard commands to pause, resume, and display specific information.
üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as GCC or MSVC.

Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flight-simulation-system.git
cd flight-simulation-system
Building the Program
Open a terminal in the project directory.

Compile the code using a C++ compiler:

bash
Copy code
g++ -o flight_simulation flight_simulation.cpp -std=c++11
Run the program:

bash
Copy code
./flight_simulation
For Windows users, run the compiled .exe file instead:

bash
Copy code
flight_simulation.exe
üïπÔ∏è Usage
Interactive Controls
Key	Action
f	Show detailed flight status for all airplanes
s	Show passenger information for each airplane
w	Display current weather condition for flights
p	Pause/resume the simulation
e	Exit the simulation
Example Output
lua
